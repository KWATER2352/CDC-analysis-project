# CDC-analysis-project
 
Hello! This is my CDC cancer data analysis project for Data Science 577. This is a project that pulls from CDC data that has been cleaned from the raw. We utilize filter, groupby, and agg functions in order to draw conclusions from the data. 

- For notebooks and data, check **src** and **data**
- For conclusions and other comments, check the **presentations** folder for the **presentation.md** file. Thank you!
